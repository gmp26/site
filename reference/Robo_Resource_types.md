**Introductory investigation**\
An exploratory task, designed to be presented with little preamble.
Students rapidly get engaged with the task, which then gives them an
opportunity to discover the relevant ideas or concepts for themselves,
perhaps by working collaboratively with others. This might well be
followed by some sort of summary, or exposition, or worked examples, to
formalise what has been found.\
\
*Examples:*Air nets (http://nrich.maths.org/6307), Impossible triangles?
(http://nrich.maths.org/5923), Picture this!
(http://nrich.maths.org/psum/picture-this/), Tilted squares
(http://nrich.maths.org/2293).

\
\

**Introductory problem\
**A task that gets students started on the sort of thinking or
mathematics in a section of work, but that is perhaps less open and
exploratory than an introductory investigation.\
\
*Examples:* Hyperbolic thinking (http://nrich.maths.org/8106), Iffy
logic (http://nrich.maths.org/6331), Mixing lemonade
(http://nrich.maths.org/6870).\
\
\

**Exposition\
**A presentation of some mathematics, perhaps in the form of an article
or a video. It might, but need not, include questions for the student to
consider while reading/watching the presentation.\
\
*Examples:* An introduction to differentiation
(http://nrich.maths.org/4722), An introduction to irrational numbers
(http://nrich.maths.org/8394), Euler’s formula and topology
(http://nrich.maths.org/1384).\
\
\

**Worked examples, with follow up**\
An illustration of a standard technique, or a standard way of presenting
an argument, for example, through carefully chosen examples. Crucially
the worked examples are followed by problems for students to try for
themselves, and while these problems are related to the worked examples,
they require more than just ‘templating’ (changing a few numbers in the
worked examples). Another sort of resource in this category could be an
invitation to the student to come up with their own examples, as a way
of getting a feel for the scope of an idea or technique.\
\
*Examples:* Summing geometric progressions
([http://nrich.maths.org/8054](http://nrich.maths.org/8054)), students
creating their own repertoire of examples (typical and boundary, etc.,
see John Mason), series grid and functions grid
(https://theoremoftheweek.wordpress.com/2013/01/25/analysis-i-lecture-4/),
Top Trumps.\
\
\

**Scaffolded task**\
A task that gives students an opportunity to engage with material that
would otherwise be out of their grasp. For example, it might be a ‘proof
sorter’ activity that enables students to understand the components of a
proof and their ordering, although creating the proof from scratch would
be beyond the students. Or it might be a ‘hide and reveal’ task, which
has a number of sections that can be revealed one at a time, to offer
some structure (e.g. subtasks leading to a big task) that helps students
to make progress on something that would otherwise be too big or
demanding.\
\
*Examples:* Easy as abc (http://nrich.maths.org/7335), Proof sorter –
quadratic equation (http://nrich.maths.org/1394), The clue is in the
question (http://nrich.maths.org/6660).\
\
\

**Problem inviting multiple approaches/representations**\
Students sometimes seize the first idea that comes to mind, when it
might not necessarily be the most effective. These problems draw
students’ attention to the thought that there might be several ways to
tackle a problem, or to represent an idea. They might do this not only
by setting a problem that can be tackled in several ways, but also by
illustrating some of these ways, or suggesting several starting points.\
\
*Examples:* Curved square (http://nrich.maths.org/6328), Marbles in a
box (http://nrich.maths.org/895), Pair products
(http://nrich.maths.org/2278), Trig reps (http://nrich.maths.org/8107),
Whose line graph is it anyway? (http://nrich.maths.org/6500).\
\
\

**Carefully designed set of problems**\
This is a set of problems that have been designed and that should be
thought of as a single entity. It might be that the problems build on
each other, so that by the end they are requiring more sophistication
but in a way that is accessible to students who have worked through the
whole set. Or it might be that by working on all of the problems, the
student is naturally prompted to explore some underlying structure or to
make a generalisation.\
\
*Examples:* Anne Watson and John Mason
(http://oro.open.ac.uk/9764/1/06\_MTL\_Watson\_%26\_Mason.pdf),
Transformations for 10 (http://nrich.maths.org/6874).\
\
\

**Messy/ill defined problem**\
Students are often used to problems being posed in such a way that they
have all the information that they require for a solution, and no more.
Problems (especially from the real world) are very often not like this,
and so resources of this type will give students the opportunity to
develop the skills needed to deal with this. Some problems might not
contain enough information to answer a question, and so students will
have to find some additional information (perhaps by making assumptions,
perhaps by asking an expert (teacher), perhaps by carrying out an
experiment, perhaps by researching online). And some problems might
contain too much data, so that part of the challenge is to identify the
useful information.\
\
*Examples:* Dan Meyer’s problems (http://nrich.maths.org/9904), Four
coloured lights (http://nrich.maths.org/7015), Tim Gowers’s problems
(http://gowers.wordpress.com/2012/06/08/how-should-mathematics-be-taught-to-non-mathematicians/),
Zin obelisk (http://nrich.maths.org/5992).\
\
\

**Open-ended investigation**\
Something for students to get stuck into. It might start with just an
interesting context, or with some initial questions to explore, but the
emphasis is on students posing their own questions, and pursuing the
avenues that interest them. This is good for developing various
mathematical skills, and gives students the opportunity to work on
things that really inspire them. These investigations might be good for
after-school clubs, or individual projects.\
\
*Examples:* Painting by numbers (http://nrich.maths.org/7020).\
\
\

**Classic problem\
**This is a problem that we think that all students should experience.
This might be because it is somehow ‘iconic’ or ‘quintessential’, or
because it illustrates something so beautifully, or because it is a
‘once-in-a-lifetime’ problem (one that everyone should do once, but that
is never quite so fresh or startling again). These are good for
developing a shared mathematical culture and repertoire.\
\
*Examples:* Got it! (http://nrich.maths.org/1272), Sasha’s collection of
problems.\
\
\

**Mathmo exercises**\
A bank of routine exercises (perhaps randomly generated) that students
can use to develop fluency. Students can be encouraged to do as many as
they need to do to feel confident and fluent with a particular idea or
technique.\
\
*Examples:* Mathmo (http://nrich.maths.org/mathmoApp/\#/mathmo).\
\
\

**Lucky dip**\
A mixed collection of problems for further practice. Students (or
teachers) might pick a problem at random, or might rummage through the
bag to find a problem that appeals to them. Working on these problems is
not necessary for understanding the topic, but it is useful to have
these problems available for additional practice and for variety. Many
of them might be fairly short.\
\
*Examples:* Ab surd ity (http://nrich.maths.org/274), Calculus countdown
(http://nrich.maths.org/6552), Epsilons (http://nrich.maths.org/9481),
Integration matcher (http://nrich.maths.org/6412), Multiplication
arithmagons (http://nrich.maths.org/7447), Power countdown
(http://nrich.maths.org/6448), UKMT weekly problems
(http://nrich.maths.org/9503), Weekly challenges
(http://nrich.maths.org/6497).\
\
\

**Review questions**\
Students will regularly want to test their understanding, both of a
particular topic and of their ability to draw together ideas from a
number of topics. Review questions might include some past examination
questions, alongside other fairly closed problems and other problems
designed to get students to look back over what they have learned. They
might be pitched at different levels, and might be flagged to show
whether they incorporate ideas from other topics.\
\
*Examples:* John Mason questions (e.g. write a list of key words from
this topic and then create a sentence that uses them all), past exam
questions, STEP questions.\
\
\

**Go and think about it…**\
A problem for which students (probably) have the required mathematical
knowledge, but where the challenge is identifying how to get started,
what tools might help, and how to apply the relevant mathematical
knowledge. Students might tackle such a problem at home, for a
challenge, as these problems are often more suited for individual
consideration than classroom collaboration.

*Examples:*Olympiad problems.*\
*\
\

**Bigger picture**\
A resource that puts the mathematics into context, perhaps by offering a
historical perspective, or describing the mathematicians who worked on
it, or linking it to areas of current research, or illustrating how it
leads on to further topics (e.g. at university level). They would not
all need to be accessible to all students: sometimes it might be
appropriate to have something that is designed for a student with a
particular interest (e.g. for a student with an interest in Physics, who
is studying A-level Physics alongside Maths). This sort of resource
might be an article or a video, for example. It might, but need not,
contain questions for the student to consider while reading or
watching.\
\
*Examples:* Plus articles.
