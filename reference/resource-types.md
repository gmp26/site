Introductory investigation
--------------------------
An exploratory task, designed to be presented with little preamble.  Students rapidly get engaged with the task, which then gives them an opportunity to discover the relevant ideas or concepts for themselves, perhaps by working collaboratively with others.  This might well be followed by some sort of summary, or exposition, or worked examples, to formalise what has been found.

###Examples
* [Air nets](http://nrich.maths.org/6307)
* [Impossible triangles?](http://nrich.maths.org/5923)
* [Picture this](http://nrich.maths.org/psum/picture-this/)
* [Tilted squares](http://nrich.maths.org/2293)

***

Introductory problem
--------------------

A task that gets students started on the sort of thinking or mathematics in a section of work, but that is perhaps less open and exploratory than an introductory investigation.

###Examples
* [Hyperbolic thinking](http://nrich.maths.org/8106)
* [Iffy logic](http://nrich.maths.org/6331)
* [Mixing lemonade](http://nrich.maths.org/6870)

***

Exposition
----------

A presentation of some mathematics, perhaps in the form of an article or a video.  It might, but need not, include questions for the student to consider while reading/watching the presentation.

###Examples
* [An introduction to differentiation](http://nrich.maths.org/4722)
* [An introduction to irrational numbers](http://nrich.maths.org/8394)
* [Euler's formula and topology](http://nrich.maths.org/1384)

***

Worked examples, with follow up
-------------------------------

An illustration of a standard technique, or a standard way of presenting an argument, for example, through carefully chosen exmaples.  Crucially the worked examples are followed by problems for students to try themselves, and while these problems are related to the worked examples, they require more than just 'templating' (changing a few numbers in the worked examples).  Another sort of resource in this category could be an invitation to the student to come up with their own examples, as a way of getting a feel for the scope of an idea or technique.

###Examples
* [Summing geometric progressions](http://nrich.maths.org/8054)
* Students creating their own repertoire of examples (typical and boundary, etc., see John Mason)
* [Series grid and functions grid](https://theoremoftheweek.wordpress.com/2013/01/25/analysis-i-lecture-4/)
* Top Trumps.
