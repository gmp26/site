# Processes---Represent: title: Representing  processes :  - identify the mathematical aspects of a situation or problem  - choose between representations  - simplify the situation or problem in order to represent it mathematically, using appropriate variables, symbols, diagrams and models  - select mathematical information, methods and tools to use.Analyse1:  title: Analysing -- Use mathematical reasoning processes:  - make connections within mathematics  - use knowledge of related problems   - visualise and work with dynamic images   - identify and classify patterns   - make and begin to justify conjectures and generalisations, considering special cases and counter-examples  - explore the effects of varying values and look for invariance and covariance  - take account of feedback and learn from mistakes   - work logically towards results and solutions, recognising the impact of    constraints and assumptions   - appreciate that there are a number of different techniques that can be used    to analyse a situation   - reason inductively and deduce.Analyse2: title: Analysing Use appropriate mathematical procedures processes:  - make accurate mathematical diagrams, graphs and constructions on paper and on screen  - calculate accurately, selecting mental methods or calculating devices as appropriate  - manipulate numbers, algebraic expressions and equations and apply routine algorithms  - use accurate notation, including correct syntax when using ICT  - record methods, solutions and conclusions  - estimate, approximate and check working.Interpret: title: Interpreting and evaluating processes:  - form convincing arguments based on findings and make general statements  - consider the assumptions made and the appropriateness and accuracy of results     and conclusions  - be aware of the strength of empirical evidence and appreciate the difference between    evidence and proof  - look at data to find patterns and exceptions  - relate findings to the original context, identifying whether they support or refute    conjectures  - engage with someone else's mathematical reasoning in the context of a problem or     particular situation  - consider the effectiveness of alternative strategies.Communicate: title: Communicating and reflecting processes:  - communicate findings effectively  - engage in mathematical discussion of results  - consider the elegance and efficiency of alternative solutions  - look for equivalence in relation to both the different approaches to the problem and    different problems with similar structures  - make connections between the current situation and outcomes, and situations and    outcomes they have already encountered
