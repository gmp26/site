Metadata and generated data
===========================

stations
--------
* id
* title
* dependencies
* key questions
* teacher support (implicitly named)

### generated
* list of links resources which are tagged primarily with this idea 
* list of pideas title (both primary and secondary) which appear in resources which have this station as a primary station.
* list of highlights 
* previous and next lists

resource types
--------------
* title
* id (for reference use by resources)
* see the list!
* link to generic teacher support

resources
---------
* title: but may be identified by resource type
* author: 
* date: (not important)
* publication status:
* resourceType: one only
* highlight: boolean or a list of stations
* stations1: primary list of stations
* stations2: secondary list of stations
* pideas1: primary list of pervasive ideas
* pideas2: secondary list of pervasive ideas

examQuestions
-------------
* source: sourceId
* publication status:
* year
* paper
* qno
* highlight: boolean or a list of stations
* stids1: primary list of stations
* stids2: secondary list of stations
* pideas1: primary list of pervasive ideas
* pideas2: secondary list of pervasive ideas

These work very much like resources except that they are not listed directly in station and pervasive ideas lists. Instead, the collection of exam questions that
appear (at a station) is assembled into a page, and that single page is listed with resource type 13 (review questions).

Sources
-------
* id
* acknowledgement


family of pervasive ideas
------------------------
title: name

pervasive ideas
---------------
* title:

* summary: quick description in a paragraph

### generated

* station list by:
	- fetch list of primary or secondary resources with this idea
	- list union of all primary stations
