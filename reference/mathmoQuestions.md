New Mathmo questions
====================

It would be very nice if the following questions could be added to Mathmo.  Perhaps they can be deleted from this list when they've been added.

I'm writing ... to mean something that the computer should generate at random; I hope that it will be clear what I have in mind.

* Find the equation of the line that passes through the points ... and ....

* Find the equation of the line that passes through the point ... and is parallel/perpendicular (computer chooses) to the line ... (perhaps this could be given sometimes in the form $y = ax + b$ and sometimes in the form $ax + by = c$).

* Find the equation of the circle with centre ... and radius ....

* Find the centre and radius of the circle with equation ... (perhaps this could be given sometimes in the form $(x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 = r^2$ and sometimes in the form $x^2 - 2ax + y^2 - 2by = C$).

* Find all the points where the line/circle ... and the line/circle ... intersect (again giving equations of lines and circles in various forms, and the computer chooses whether to give lines or circles).
