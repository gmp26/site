New Mathmo questions
====================

It would be very nice if the following questions could be added to Mathmo.  Perhaps they can be deleted from this list when they've been added.

I'm writing ... to mean something that the computer should generate at random; I hope that it will be clear what I have in mind.

* Find the equation of the line that passes through the points ... and ....

* Find the equation of the line that passes through the point ... and is parallel/perpendicular (computer chooses) to the line ... (perhaps this could be given sometimes in the form $y = ax + b$ and sometimes in the form $ax + by = c$).

* Find the equation of the circle with centre ... and radius ....

* Find the centre and radius of the circle with equation ... (perhaps this could be given sometimes in the form $(x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 = r^2$ and sometimes in the form $x^2 - 2ax + y^2 - 2by = C$).

* Find all the points where the line/circle ... and the line/circle ... intersect (again giving equations of lines and circles in various forms, and the computer chooses whether to give lines or circles).

* Find the distance between the points ... and ....  [It would be good to have a mix of positive and negative coordinates, a mix of integer coordinates and coordinates expressed as fractions and coordinates expressed as decimals and coordinates expressed as surds, if possible.  Anything to get away from the inevitable Pythagorean triples.]

* Find the highest common factor of ... and ....  [I'm expect them to use Euclid, so the numbers could say go up to 99999 or even 999999 if you're feeling mean.  Positive integers only, please!]

* Find the centre and radius of the circle passing through the points ... and ... and ....  [I think that the nice way to do this is to find the circumcentre of the triangle by finding the point of intersection of two of the perpendicular bisectors of sides of the triangle and then computing the radius afterwards.]

* Find the least common multiple of ... and ....  [Probably best not to use very large numbers for this.]

* Find all integer solutions $m$ and $n$ to the equation $...m + ...n = ...$.  [Let's make the first two coefficients positive, and say up to 999, and the right-hand side any integer (say between -999 and 999).]
