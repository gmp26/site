            <p>Find the largest integer that divides every term of the sequence <span class="math">\(1^5-1\)</span>, <span class="math">\(2^5-2\)</span>, <span class="math">\(3^5-3\)</span>, …, <span class="math">\(n^5 - n\)</span>, ….</p>
<p>Can you generalise your findings?</p>

          </div>

          <div class="tab-pane" id="tab1">
            <p>The general term of this sequence is <span class="math">\(n^5-n\)</span>. We can factorise this expression as follows, using the expression for the difference of two squares:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[n^5-n=n(n^4-1)\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math">\[=n(n^2-1)(n^2+1)\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math">\[=n(n-1)(n+1)(n^2+1).\]</span></p>
<p>This expression is divisible by <span class="math">\(2\)</span>. That’s because <span class="math">\(n\)</span> and <span class="math">\(n+1\)</span> are two consecutive integers, so one of them must be even and the other odd. Then, as <span class="math">\(n^5-n\)</span> is divisible by both <span class="math">\(n\)</span> and <span class="math">\(n+1\)</span>, it has at least one even factor and must therefore be even (the product of an even integer and any other integer is always even).</p>
<p>This expression is also divisible by <span class="math">\(3\)</span>. That’s because <span class="math">\(n-1\)</span>, <span class="math">\(n\)</span> and <span class="math">\(n+1\)</span> are three consecutive integers, so one of them must be a multiple of <span class="math">\(3\)</span>. We can see this by considering the remainder left upon dividing <span class="math">\(n\)</span> by <span class="math">\(3\)</span>: the only possible values are <span class="math">\(0\)</span>, <span class="math">\(1\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(2\)</span>. If it is <span class="math">\(0\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(n\)</span> is a multiple of <span class="math">\(3\)</span>. If it is <span class="math">\(3\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(n-1\)</span> is a multiple of <span class="math">\(3\)</span>. If it is <span class="math">\(2\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(n+1\)</span> is a multiple of <span class="math">\(3\)</span>.</p>
<p>Similarly to above, since <span class="math">\(n^5-n\)</span> is divisible by <span class="math">\(n-1\)</span>, <span class="math">\(n\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(n+1\)</span>, it must have a factor which is a multiple of <span class="math">\(3\)</span>, and therefore must itself be divisible by <span class="math">\(3\)</span>.</p>
<p>This expression is also divisible by <span class="math">\(5\)</span>, although this is slightly tricker to show than in the previous two parts. Firstly, we consider the remainder left when we divide <span class="math">\(n\)</span> by <span class="math">\(5\)</span>. This can take the values <span class="math">\(0\)</span>, <span class="math">\(1\)</span>, <span class="math">\(2\)</span>, <span class="math">\(3\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(4\)</span>. We’ll consider the five cases separately.</p>
<hr>
<h5 id="case-1">Case 1</h5>
<p>If this remainder is <span class="math">\(0\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(n\)</span> itself is divisible by <span class="math">\(5\)</span>, and then so is <span class="math">\(n^5-n\)</span>, since it is divisible by <span class="math">\(n\)</span>.</p>
<h5 id="case-2">Case 2</h5>
<p>If this remainder is <span class="math">\(1\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(n-1\)</span> is divisible by <span class="math">\(5\)</span>, and then so is <span class="math">\(n^5-n\)</span>, as it is divisible by <span class="math">\(n-1\)</span>.</p>
<h5 id="case-3">Case 3</h5>
<p>If this remainder is <span class="math">\(2\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(n\)</span> is <span class="math">\(2\)</span> greater than a multiple of <span class="math">\(5\)</span>. That is, we can write <span class="math">\(n=5k+2\)</span> for some integer <span class="math">\(k\)</span>. Then <span class="math">\[n^2+1=(5k+2)^2+1\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math">\[=25k^2+20k+4+1\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math">\[=25k^2+20k+5\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math">\[=5(5k^2+4k+1).\]</span></p>
<p>As <span class="math">\(k\)</span> is an integer, <span class="math">\(5k^2+4k+1\)</span> is also an integer, and so <span class="math">\(n^2+1\)</span> is a multiple of <span class="math">\(5\)</span>. Then so is <span class="math">\(n^5-5\)</span>, as it is divisible by <span class="math">\(n^2+1\)</span>.</p>
<h5 id="case-4">Case 4</h5>
<p>Similarly, if this remainder is <span class="math">\(3\)</span>, then we can write <span class="math">\(n=5m+3\)</span>, for some integer <span class="math">\(m\)</span>. Then</p>
<p><span class="math">\[n^2+1=(5m+3)^2+1\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math">\[=25m^2+30m+10\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math">\[=5(5m^2+6m+2).\]</span></p>
<p>So again, <span class="math">\(n^2+1\)</span> is a multiple of <span class="math">\(5\)</span>, meaning that <span class="math">\(n^5-n\)</span> is too.</p>
<h5 id="case-5">Case 5</h5>
<p>If the remainder is <span class="math">\(4\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(n+1\)</span> is divisible by <span class="math">\(5\)</span>, and then so is <span class="math">\(n^5-n\)</span>, as it is divisible by <span class="math">\(n+1\)</span>.</p>
<hr>
<p>We have shown that, for all <span class="math">\(n\)</span>, <span class="math">\(n^5-n\)</span> is divisible by <span class="math">\(2\)</span>, <span class="math">\(3\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(5\)</span>. This means that every term in the sequence is divisible by the lowest common multiple of <span class="math">\(2\)</span>, <span class="math">\(3\)</span> and <span class="math">\(5\)</span>. In this case this is simply their product, <span class="math">\(30\)</span>, as they have no common prime factors.</p>
<p>So <span class="math">\(30\)</span> divides every number in the sequence. This means that the largest integer which divides every term in the sequence must be at least <span class="math">\(30\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now, look at the second term in the sequence: <span class="math">\(2^5-2\)</span>. This is equal to <span class="math">\(30\)</span>, which obviously is not divisible by any integers greater than itself. So, <span class="math">\(30\)</span> is the largest integer which divides every term in the sequence.</p>
