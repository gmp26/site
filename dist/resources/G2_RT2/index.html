          </div>

          <div class="tab-pane" id="tab1">
            <ol type="1">
<li><p>There are many ways of tackling this problem. Here is just one of those ways.</p>
<p>We recall that <span class="math">\(y=mx+c\)</span> describes a unique straight line. Therefore, any equation involving <span class="math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y\)</span> which can be rearranged into that form describes a straight line.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>The equation <span class="math">\(4x-2y=6\)</span> can be rearranged to give <span class="math">\(y=2x-3\)</span>, so it describes a unique straight line.</p></li>
<li><p>We note that <span class="math">\(y=2\)</span> is of the form <span class="math">\(y=mx+c\)</span> with <span class="math">\(m=0\)</span> and <span class="math">\(c=2\)</span>, so it also describes a straight line.</p></li>
<li><div class="chalk">
The idea is that for any two (distinct) points there is always a unique straight line going through both points. Can you see why?
</div></li>
</ol>
<p>The straight line going through the two points <span class="math">\((1,2)\)</span> and <span class="math">\((0,-1)\)</span> must have <span class="math">\[m = \frac{2-(-1)}{1-0}=3.\]</span> By substituting <span class="math">\(x=0\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y=-1\)</span> into <span class="math">\(y=3x+c\)</span> we obtain <span class="math">\(c=-1\)</span>. Hence, the unique straight line passing through <span class="math">\((1,2)\)</span> and <span class="math">\((0,-1)\)</span> has equation <span class="math">\(y=3x-1\)</span>.</p>
<ol start="4" type="a">
<li><p>The equation <span class="math">\(y=4x\)</span> is of the above form and so describes a straight line.</p></li>
<li><p>This also describes a straight line and in fact, we obtain the same straight line as in part a because both lines are described by the same equation.</p></li>
<li><div class="chalk">
An alternative way to describe a straight line is using vectors: by specifying a fixed point and a direction vector we are uniquely describing the straight line that passes through the given fixed point in the direction of the vector.
</div></li>
</ol>
<p>The equation of the straight line described by the point and the direction vector given must have <span class="math">\(m=2/1=2\)</span> and <span class="math">\(c=-3\)</span>. (The latter can be obtained by substituting <span class="math">\(x=y=3\)</span> into <span class="math">\(y=2x+c\)</span>.) Note that <span class="math">\(y=2x-3\)</span> is the same equation as in parts a and e.</p>
<ol start="7" type="a">
<li><p>The original equation can be rearranged to give <span class="math">\(y=\frac{1}{7}x\)</span>, so this also describes a straight line (passing through the origin).</p></li>
<li><p>From part c, recall that for any two distinct points there is a unique straight line passing through both points. Therefore, three points describe a straight line only if the third point lies on the straight line passing through the first two points. The equation of the straight line through <span class="math">\((-1,-4)\)</span> and <span class="math">\((3,7)\)</span> is <span class="math">\(y=\frac{11}{4}x - \frac{5}{4}\)</span>. However, <span class="math">\(x=y=8\)</span> does not satisfy this equation. Thus, the three points do not lie on the same straight line.</p>
<div class="chalk">
In fact, the three points given describe three different straight lines: the one through <span class="math">\((-1,-4)\)</span> and <span class="math">\((3,7)\)</span>, the one through <span class="math">\((-1,-4)\)</span> and <span class="math">\((8,8)\)</span>, and the one through <span class="math">\((3,7)\)</span> and <span class="math">\((8,8)\)</span>.
</div></li>
<li><p>This can be rearranged to give <span class="math">\(y=3x+16\)</span> and so it also describes a straight line.</p></li>
<li><p>We repeat what we did in part h and this time all three points lie on the straight line with equation <span class="math">\(y=2x-3\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><div class="chalk">
You might argue that <span class="math">\(y=x^2+2\)</span> is the equation of a parabola and so it cannot describe a straight line. But are you really convinced by this? Below, we make this idea into a rigorous argument.
</div></li>
</ol>
<p>The parabola described by <span class="math">\(y=x^2+2\)</span> passes through the points <span class="math">\((-1,3)\)</span>, <span class="math">\((0,2)\)</span> and <span class="math">\((1,3)\)</span>. However, whereas the first and third points lie on the straight line with equation <span class="math">\(y=3\)</span> the second one does not. So, the equation <span class="math">\(y=x^2+2\)</span> cannot describe a straight line.</p>
<ol start="12" type="a">
<li><p>The equation <span class="math">\(y^2=x^2\)</span> can be rearranged to give <span class="math">\((x-y)(x+y) = 0\)</span>, so it describes the two straight lines <span class="math">\(y=x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y=-x\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Rearranging the given equation yields <span class="math">\(y=\frac{1}{14}x+\frac{2}{7}\)</span>, so it describes a straight line.</p></li>
<li><p>The approach is similar to what we did in part k. It is possible to find three points that satisfy <span class="math">\(xy = 1\)</span> but do not lie on the same straight line (for example, <span class="math">\((1,1)\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\left(2,\frac{1}{2}\right)\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\left(\frac{1}{2},2\right)\)</span>), showing that <span class="math">\(xy = 1\)</span> is not a straight line.</p></li>
<li><p>We note that <span class="math">\(y^2-4xy+4x^2=(y-2x)^2\)</span>, so the equation given does indeed describe a straight line—the straight line with equation <span class="math">\(y=2x\)</span>.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>In question 1, we encountered three different descriptions of a straight line.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For any real values <span class="math">\(m\)</span> and <span class="math">\(c\)</span> the equation <span class="math">\(y=mx+c\)</span> describes a straight line. More generally, the equation of any straight line in the <span class="math">\(x\)</span>-<span class="math">\(y\)</span> plane can be rearranged into the form <span class="math">\(ax+by=c\)</span>.</p>
<div class="chalk">
The advantage of the latter form is that it includes straight lines which are parallel to the <span class="math">\(y\)</span>-axis, e.g. <span class="math">\(x=4\)</span>.
</div></li>
<li><p>A straight line can be described uniquely by specifying two distinct points through which the line passes.</p></li>
<li><p>Alternatively, it also suffices to specify one point and a direction vector to describe a unique straight line such as in part 1f.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, there are other ways to describe a unique straight line. For instance, instead of finding the unique straight line passing through two given points, we could instead consider the set of points equidistant to these two points. It turns out that this is again a straight line.</p></li>
<li><div class="chalk">
In question 1, we rearranged all the equations that described a straight line into the form <span class="math">\(y=mx+c\)</span>. This now makes it a lot easier to decide which equations describe the same straight line.
</div>
<p>Going back to our results from question 1, we see that parts a, e, f and j all describe the same straight line. We note that these four parts correspond to four different descriptions of the same straight line.</p></li>
<li><p>Let’s consider the first two descriptions mentioned in the solution to question 2.</p>
<p>If we are given the equation <span class="math">\(ax+by=c\)</span> of a straight line then we can easily find two distinct points which lie on this line: just pick two distinct values for <span class="math">\(x\)</span> and compute the corresponding <span class="math">\(y\)</span>-values.</p>
<p>Conversely, if we are given two arbitrary points <span class="math">\((x_1,y_1)\)</span> and <span class="math">\((x_2,y_2)\)</span> then we can obtain the equation of the straight line going through both points in the following way. If we have <span class="math">\(x_1=x_2\)</span> then the straight line is described by the equation <span class="math">\(x=x_1\)</span>. Otherwise, the gradient of the straight line through both points must be <span class="math">\(m=(y_2-y_1)/(x_2-x_1)\)</span> and the value of <span class="math">\(c\)</span> can be computed by substituting <span class="math">\(x=x_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y=y_1\)</span> into <span class="math">\(y=mx+c\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Which of the above descriptions is more useful than another always depends on the context you are working in.</p>
<p>For instance, as remarked earlier, one disadvantage of the description <span class="math">\(y=mx+c\)</span> is that it does not include straight lines parallel to the <span class="math">\(y\)</span>-axis. On the other hand, contrary to the description by the equation <span class="math">\(ax+by=c\)</span> or by just specifying two points, you can easily read off the gradient and the <span class="math">\(y\)</span>-intercept of the corresponding straight line from <span class="math">\(y=mx+c\)</span>.</p></li>
