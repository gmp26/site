I know the standard equation of a circle so to begin I could try to rearrange the equation to look like that, but I think that the question really wants me to go back to first principles and show directly that these points lie on a circle. I know that a circle is the set of points lying an equal distance from the centre. Maybe I can use that?

              <p>Completing the square gives us the equation in the form <span class="math">\[(x+g)^2+(y-f)^2=g^2+f^2+c. \qquad \qquad(\ast)\]</span></p>
<p>By Pythagoras’ Theorem, the distance between the points <span class="math">\((x_1,y_1)\)</span> and <span class="math">\((x_2,y_2)\)</span> is <span class="math">\[\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2}.\]</span></p>
<p>Taking square roots of both sides of <span class="math">\((\ast)\)</span> gives <span class="math">\[\sqrt{(x+g)^2+(y-f)^2}=\sqrt{g^2+f^2+c}\]</span> and so the distance between points <span class="math">\((x,y)\)</span> and <span class="math">\((-g,f)\)</span> is <span class="math">\(\sqrt{g^2+f^2+c}\)</span>. Therefore all points which satisfy this equation are the same distance away from <span class="math">\((-g,f)\)</span>, which shows they lie on a circle.</p>
<p>The circle has centre <span class="math">\((-g,f)\)</span> and radius <span class="math">\(\sqrt{g^2+f^2+c}\)</span>.</p>
<div class="chalk">
We have explained why the points satisfying <span class="math">\[(x-a)^2+(y-b)^2=r^2\]</span> lie on a circle with centre <span class="math">\((a,b)\)</span> and radius <span class="math">\(r\)</span>. In the next part of the question we can use this to quickly identify the centres and radii of the circles.
</div>
<p>Call the first circle <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and the second circle <span class="math">\(B\)</span>.</p>
<p>Circle <span class="math">\(A\)</span>: Using the form of the first part, <span class="math">\(g=-10\)</span>, <span class="math">\(f=-8\)</span>, <span class="math">\(c=128\)</span>. So <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is a circle with centre <span class="math">\((10,8)\)</span> and radius <span class="math">\(\sqrt{(-10)^2+(-8)^2-128}=\sqrt{36}=6\)</span>.</p>
<p>Circle <span class="math">\(B\)</span>: Divide the equation by <span class="math">\(4\)</span> to give <span class="math">\[x^2+y^2+4x-6y-\frac{29}{4}=0\]</span> which is of the same form as the first part. Then <span class="math">\(g=2\)</span>, <span class="math">\(f=-3\)</span>, <span class="math">\(c=-\frac{29}{4}\)</span>, so this is a circle with centre <span class="math">\((-2,3)\)</span> and radius <span class="math">\(\sqrt{2^2+(-3)^2+\frac{29}{4}}=\sqrt{\frac{81}{4}}=\frac{9}{2}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Because the <span class="math">\(x\)</span>-coordinate of the centre of circle <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is <span class="math">\(10\)</span> and the radius is <span class="math">\(6\)</span>, all points on the circle have <span class="math">\(x\)</span>-coordinates in the range <span class="math">\(4\leq x\leq16\)</span>.</p>
<p>Similarly, all points on circle <span class="math">\(B\)</span> have <span class="math">\(x\)</span>-coordinates in the range <span class="math">\(-\frac{13}{2}\leq x\leq\frac{5}{2}\)</span>.</p>
<p>But <span class="math">\(\frac{5}{2} &lt; 4\)</span>, so the two ranges of <span class="math">\(x\)</span> do not overlap, therefore the two circles lie entirely outside each other.</p>
<div class="chalk">
<p>The points with the shortest distance are the points lying on the line joining the two centres.</p>
</div>
<p>To find the length of the shortest distance between the two circles consider the diagram below.</p>
<figure>
<img src="Q1solutionfigure.png" alt="Figure 1"><figcaption>Figure 1</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>By Pythagoras’ Theorem, the length of the hypotenuse of the triangle is <span class="math">\(\sqrt{12^2+5^2}=\sqrt{169}=13\)</span>.</p>
<p>Therefore the shortest distance between the two circles is <span class="math">\(13-(6+\frac{9}{2})=\frac{5}{2}\)</span>.</p>

I’m trying to find the circumcentre of three points—that would be a good start. So I want a point that’s equidistant from the three given points. I think that I know something about the locus of points equidistant from <em>two</em> given points. Perhaps I can use that…

              <div class="chalk">
We can think about solving the first part of this problem in two ways. The first involves thinking about the algebraic equation of a circle.
</div>
<h3 id="method-1">Method 1</h3>
<p>The general equation of a circle with radius <span class="math">\(r\)</span> and centre <span class="math">\((a,b)\)</span> is <span class="math">\((x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 = r^2\)</span>.</p>
<p>Substituting <span class="math">\((x,y) = (2,0)\)</span>, <span class="math">\((x,y) = (8,0)\)</span> and <span class="math">\((x,y) = (10,4)\)</span> into this equation for a circle, we get three simultaneous equations in <span class="math">\(a\)</span>, <span class="math">\(b\)</span> and <span class="math">\(r\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[(2-a)^2 + b^2 = r^2\]</span></p>
<p>and</p>
<p><span class="math">\[(8-a)^2 + b^2 = r^2\]</span></p>
<p>and</p>
<p><span class="math">\[(10-a)^2 + (4-b)^2 = r^2.\]</span></p>
<p>Taking the first equation away from the second, and expanding, we find the value of a:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[(8-a)^2 - (2-a)^2 = 0 \iff 64 - 16a + a^2 = 4 - 4a + a^2 \iff 60 = 12a \iff a = 5.\]</span></p>
<p>Substituting <span class="math">\(a=5\)</span> into the second and third equations, we get</p>
<p><span class="math">\[9 + b^2 = r^2\]</span> and <span class="math">\[25 + (4-b)^2 = r^2.\]</span></p>
<p>Taking the first equation away from the second, and expanding, we find the value of <span class="math">\(b\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[25 + (4-b)^2 - 9 - b^2 = 0 \iff 25 + 16 - 8b + b^2 - 9 - b^2 = 0 \iff 32 = 8b \iff b = 4.\]</span></p>
<p>Now, substituting <span class="math">\(b=4\)</span> into the equation <span class="math">\(25 + (4-b)^2 = r^2\)</span> from above, we get:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[25 = r^2\]</span>.</p>
<p>This is true if, and only if, <span class="math">\(r = 5\)</span>.</p>
<div class="chalk">
We know that <span class="math">\(r\)</span> must be 5 rather than <span class="math">\(-5\)</span> as the radius of a circle must be positive.
</div>
<p>So the equation of this circle is <span class="math">\((x-5)^2 + (y-4)^2 = 25\)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="method-2">Method 2</h3>
<div class="chalk">
The second way of looking at this problem involves thinking about the circle geometrically.
</div>
<p>Given any three points, we can think of a triangle with these points as its vertices. It is a fact that there is a unique circle passing through these three points, whose centre is the <em>circumcentre</em> of the triangle we just described—that is, the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of the three sides.</p>
<p>Our three points are <span class="math">\(A=(2,0)\)</span>, <span class="math">\(B=(8,0)\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(C=(10,4)\)</span>. The line segment between <span class="math">\((2,0)\)</span> and <span class="math">\((8,0)\)</span> is part of the <span class="math">\(x\)</span>-axis, with midpoint <span class="math">\(\left(\frac{2+8}{2},\frac{0+0}{2}\right)=(5,0)\)</span>. So the perpendicular bisector of the side <span class="math">\(AB\)</span> is the line <span class="math">\(x=5\)</span>.</p>
<p>The line segment between <span class="math">\((8,0)\)</span> and <span class="math">\((10,4)\)</span> has gradient <span class="math">\(\frac{4}{2}=2\)</span> and midpoint <span class="math">\(\left(\frac{8+10}{2},\frac{0+4}{2}\right)=(9,2)\)</span>. So the perpendicular bisector of side <span class="math">\(BC\)</span> is the line with gradient <span class="math">\(\frac{-1}{2}\)</span> and passing through the point <span class="math">\((9,2)\)</span>. Substituting this information into the general equation for a line <span class="math">\(y=mx+c\)</span>, we find that the perpendicular bisector of side BC is the line <span class="math">\(y=\frac{-1}{2}x+\frac{13}{2}\)</span>.</p>
<div class="chalk">
<p>We could also calculate the perpendicular bisector of side <span class="math">\(CA\)</span>, which turns out to be the line <span class="math">\(y=-2x+14\)</span>.</p>
But we don’t need to do this, because we are using the standard fact that the three perpendicular bisectors of the sides of a triangle meet at a single point. You could check that this is true in this specific case if you wanted.
</div>
<p>Substituting <span class="math">\(x=5\)</span> into <span class="math">\(y=\frac{-1}{2}x + \frac{13}{2}\)</span>, we get the equation <span class="math">\(y=-\frac{5}{2}+\frac{13}{2}\)</span> which is true if and only if <span class="math">\(y=4\)</span>. So these two perpendicular bisectors intersect at the point <span class="math">\((5,4)\)</span>, making this the centre of the circle.</p>
<p>Now, it is easy to find the radius of the circle—simply find the distance between the centre and one of the points given.</p>
<p>The distance between <span class="math">\(A=(2,0)\)</span> and <span class="math">\((5,4)\)</span> is <span class="math">\(\sqrt{(2-5)^2+(0-4)^2}=\sqrt{25}=5\)</span>.</p>
<p>So the circle passing through these three points has centre <span class="math">\((5,4)\)</span> and radius <span class="math">\(5\)</span>. This means that it has equation <span class="math">\[(x-5)^2 + (y-4)^2 = 25.\]</span></p>
<hr>
<p>On the <span class="math">\(y\)</span>-axis, we know that <span class="math">\(x=0\)</span>.</p>
<p>Substituting <span class="math">\(x=0\)</span> into the equation for this circle, we get: <span class="math">\(25 + (y-4)^2 = 25 \iff (y-4)^2 = 0\)</span>.</p>
<p>This equation has only one solution, <span class="math">\(y=4\)</span>, so the circle touches the <span class="math">\(y\)</span>-axis.</p>
<div class="chalk">
Setting <span class="math">\(x=0\)</span> in the equation for the circle gives an equation in <span class="math">\(y\)</span>. If <span class="math">\(y=d\)</span> is a solution to this equation, then the circle intersects the <span class="math">\(y\)</span>-axis at <span class="math">\((0,d)\)</span>. If this equation only has one solution, then the circle meets the <span class="math">\(y\)</span>-axis at only one point, and therefore the <span class="math">\(y\)</span>-axis must be a tangent to the circle.
</div>
<hr>
<p>Any line passing through the origin that is not the <span class="math">\(y\)</span>-axis must have equation <span class="math">\(y=mx\)</span> for some real number <span class="math">\(m\)</span>. We want to find an <span class="math">\(m\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(y=mx\)</span> and <span class="math">\((x-5)^2+(y-4)^2=25\)</span> intersect at exactly one point—then <span class="math">\(y=mx\)</span> will be a tangent to the circle passing through the origin.</p>
<p>Substituting <span class="math">\(y=mx\)</span> into <span class="math">\((x-5)^2+(y-4)^2=25\)</span> and expanding, we get a quadratic equation in <span class="math">\(x\)</span> with coefficients in <span class="math">\(m\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[(x-5)^2 + (mx-4)^2 = 25\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math">\[\iff x^2 - 10x + 25 + m^2x^2 - 8mx + 16 = 25\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math">\[\iff (m^2 +1)x^2 + (-10 - 8m)x+16 = 0.\]</span></p>
<p>For <span class="math">\(y=mx\)</span> to be a tangent to the circle, we must have only one root to this quadratic equation—that is, its discriminant must be zero.</p>
<div class="chalk">
The discriminant of a quadratic equation <span class="math">\(ax^2+bx+c = 0\)</span> is <span class="math">\(b^2-4ac\)</span>. The discriminant equals zero if, and only if, the equation has a repeated root.
</div>
<p>Now</p>
<p><span class="math">\[(-10-8m)^2 - 4(m^2+1)(16) = 0\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math">\[\iff 100+160m+64m^2-64(m^2+1)=0\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math">\[\iff 100+160m+64m^2-64m^2-64=0\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math">\[\iff 160m+36=0\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math">\[\iff m=\frac{-9}{40}.\]</span></p>
<p>So <span class="math">\(y=\frac{-9}{40}x\)</span> is the equation of this tangent.</p>

For the line to ‘touch’ the circle there must be exactly one point of intersection between them—the line must be a tangent to the circle.
</div>
<p>To find the points of intersection of the line and circle we need to solve their equations for <span class="math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y\)</span>.</p>
<p>Substituting <span class="math">\(y = mx + c\)</span> into <span class="math">\(x^2 + y^2 = 25\)</span> gives <span class="math">\[x^2 + (mx+c)^2 = 25\]</span> <span class="math">\[\iff (1+m^2)x^2 + 2mcx + c^2 - 25 = 0.\]</span> This is a quadratic equation in <span class="math">\(x\)</span> and has discriminant <span class="math">\[(2mc)^2 - 4 (1+m^2) (c^2-25) = 4 (25 (1+m^2) - c^2).\]</span></p>
<p>If <span class="math">\(c^2 = 25(1+m^2)\)</span> then the discriminant is <span class="math">\(0\)</span>. This tells us that there is exactly one value of <span class="math">\(x\)</span> which satisfies this quadratic and hence the simultaneous equations. Since <span class="math">\(y = mx + c\)</span> is a linear equation in <span class="math">\(x\)</span>, this corresponds to exactly one value of <span class="math">\(y\)</span>. Therefore the line and circle intersect at exactly one point.</p>

<div class="chalk">
We can save some time by using the first part of the question to solve the next part.
</div>
<p>We want to find straight lines of the form <span class="math">\(y=mx+c\)</span> which go through the the point <span class="math">\((2,11)\)</span> and are tangents to the circle.</p>
<p>Substituting the coordinates <span class="math">\((2,11)\)</span> into <span class="math">\(y=mx+c\)</span> gives <span class="math">\(11 = 2m + c\)</span> and from the first part we must have <span class="math">\(c^2 = 25(1+m^2)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now we have simultaneous equations for <span class="math">\(m\)</span> and <span class="math">\(c\)</span> which we can solve.</p>
<p>Substituting for <span class="math">\(c\)</span> gives <span class="math">\[(11-2m)^2 = 25(1+m^2),\]</span> which rearranges to give <span class="math">\[21m^2 + 44m - 96 = 0 \]</span> <span class="math">\[\iff (3m-4) (7m+24) = 0 .\]</span> So <span class="math">\(m = \frac{4}{3}\)</span> or <span class="math">\(m = - \frac{24}{7}\)</span>.</p>
<p>If <span class="math">\(m = \frac{4}{3}\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(c = 11 - 2 \frac{4}{3} = \frac{25}{3}\)</span>, and if <span class="math">\(m = - \frac{24}{7}\)</span> then <span class="math">\(c = 11 - 2 \frac{(-24)}{7} = \frac{125}{7}\)</span>.</p>
<p>So the two tangents are <span class="math">\[y= \frac{4}{3} x + \frac{25}{3}\]</span> and <span class="math">\[y= - \frac{24}{7} x + \frac{125}{7}.\]</span></p>

              <div class="chalk">
For the circles to touch, we must show that they intersect at exactly one point.
</div>
<p>We have the equations of the two circles: <span class="math">\[x^2 + y^2 = 25\]</span> and <span class="math">\[x^2 + y^2 - 24x - 18y + 125 = 0.\]</span></p>
<p>Substituting the first equation into the second gives <span class="math">\[25 - 24x - 18y + 125 = 0\]</span> <span class="math">\[\Rightarrow 24x + 18y = 150\]</span> <span class="math">\[\Rightarrow 4x + 3y = 25.\]</span></p>
<div class="chalk">
We have shown that if <span class="math">\((x,y)\)</span> lies on both circles then it also lies on the line <span class="math">\(4x + 3y = 25\)</span>. Since <span class="math">\(4x + 3y = 25\)</span> is a straight line, there are infinitely many points <span class="math">\((x,y)\)</span> that satisfy this equation. We need to show that there is only one point on this line that also lies on the two circles.
</div>
<p>We can rearrange <span class="math">\(4x + 3y = 25\)</span> to get <span class="math">\[x = \frac{1}{4}(25-3y)\]</span> and substitute into the equation <span class="math">\(x^2 + y^2 = 25\)</span>: <span class="math">\[\left(\frac{1}{4}(25-3y)\right)^2 +y^2 = 25\]</span> <span class="math">\[\iff 25y^2 - 150y + 225 = 0\]</span> <span class="math">\[\iff y^2 - 6y + 9 = 0\]</span> <span class="math">\[\iff (y-3)^2 = 0\]</span> <span class="math">\[\iff y = 3.\]</span></p>
<div class="chalk">
The quadratic equation has a repeated root, so has exactly one solution. This means that the line <span class="math">\(4x + 3y = 25\)</span> and the circle <span class="math">\(x^2 + y^2 = 25\)</span> meet at only one point. That is, there is only one point that lies on both the line <span class="math">\(4x + 3y = 25\)</span> and the circle <span class="math">\(x^2 + y^2 = 25\)</span>.
</div>
<p>We can find the corresponding <span class="math">\(x\)</span> value by setting <span class="math">\(y = 3\)</span> in the equation <span class="math">\(4x + 3y = 25\)</span>: <span class="math">\[4x + 3(3) = 25\]</span> <span class="math">\[\Rightarrow x = 4.\]</span></p>
<p>We can check that the point <span class="math">\((4,3)\)</span> lies on the circle <span class="math">\(x^2 + y^2 - 24x - 18y + 125 = 0\)</span>: we have <span class="math">\[4^2 + 3^2 - 24(4) - 18(3) + 125 = 0.\]</span></p>
<p>So the circles <span class="math">\(x^2 + y^2 = 25\)</span> and <span class="math">\(x^2 + y^2 - 24x - 18y + 125 = 0\)</span> touch only at the point <span class="math">\((4,3)\)</span>.</p>

          <div class="tab-pane" id="tabQ6_2">

              <div class="chalk">
The first thing we want to do is rewrite the equation of the circle in the form <span class="math">\((x-a)^2+(y-b)^2=r^2\)</span> so that we can easily work out its centre and radius.
</div>
<p>We have</p>
<p><span class="math">\[x^2+y^2+4x-8y-80=0\]</span> <span class="math">\[\iff [(x+2)^2 - 4] + [(y-4)^2-16] - 80 =0\]</span> <span class="math">\[\iff (x+2)^2 + (y-4)^2 = 100.\]</span></p>
<p>This circle has centre <span class="math">\((-2,4)\)</span> and radius <span class="math">\(10\)</span>. This means that a point <span class="math">\(Q\)</span> lies inside this circle if and only if the distance between <span class="math">\(Q\)</span> and the point <span class="math">\((-2,4)\)</span> is less than <span class="math">\(10\)</span>.</p>
<p>So, to show that <span class="math">\(P\)</span> lies inside this circle, we must show that the distance between <span class="math">\((-9,-3)\)</span> and <span class="math">\((-2,4)\)</span> is less than <span class="math">\(10\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math">\(d\)</span> be the distance between <span class="math">\((-9,-3)\)</span> and <span class="math">\((-2,4)\)</span>. Then</p>
<p><span class="math">\[d = \sqrt{(-9-(-2))^2+(-3-4)^2}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math">\[= \sqrt{(-7)^2+(-7)^2}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math">\[= \sqrt{49+49}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math">\[= \sqrt{98}\]</span></p>
<p>Now <span class="math">\(\sqrt{98} &lt; \sqrt{100} = 10\)</span>. That is, the distance between P and <span class="math">\((-2,4)\)</span> is less than <span class="math">\(10\)</span>, so <span class="math">\(P\)</span> lies inside the circle.</p>
<hr>
<p>Let <span class="math">\(C\)</span> be a circle of radius <span class="math">\(5\)</span>, passing through <span class="math">\(P = (-9,-3)\)</span> and touching the circle <span class="math">\((x+2)^2+(y-4)^2=100\)</span>. We want to find the centre of <span class="math">\(C\)</span>. Call the centre <span class="math">\((a,b)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Firstly, as <span class="math">\(C\)</span> passes through <span class="math">\((-9,-3)\)</span>, and as <span class="math">\(C\)</span> has radius <span class="math">\(5\)</span>, we know that <span class="math">\((a,b)\)</span> and <span class="math">\((-9,-3)\)</span> are a distance of <span class="math">\(5\)</span> apart. So <span class="math">\((a,b)\)</span> must lie on the circle <span class="math">\((x+9)^2+(y+3)^2=25\)</span>, and therefore<br><span class="math">\[(a+9)^2+(b+3)^2=25.\]</span></p>
<p>We also know that <span class="math">\(C\)</span> just touches the circle <span class="math">\((x+2)^2+(y-4)^2=100\)</span>. So the centre of <span class="math">\(C\)</span>, <span class="math">\((a,b)\)</span>, must lie a distance of exactly <span class="math">\(5\)</span> away from one point on this circle, and a distance of greater than <span class="math">\(5\)</span> away from all other points on this circle. This means that <span class="math">\((a,b)\)</span> must lie on one of the faded circles in the diagram below.</p>
<figure>
<img src="Q6diagram1.png" alt="Diagram"><figcaption>Diagram</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We know that <span class="math">\((a,b)\)</span> cannot lie on the outer circle because then the distance between <span class="math">\((a,b)\)</span> and <span class="math">\((-9,-3)\)</span> would be greater than <span class="math">\(5\)</span> units, because <span class="math">\((-9,-3)\)</span> lies inside the circle. So <span class="math">\((a,b)\)</span> must lie on the inner circle, which has equation <span class="math">\((x+2)^2+(y-4)^2=25\)</span>. Therefore<br><span class="math">\[(a+2)^2+(b-4)^2=25.\]</span></p>
<p>This means that we now have two equations which <span class="math">\((a,b)\)</span> must satisfy:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[(a+9)^2+(b+3)^2=25\]</span></p>
<p>and</p>
<p><span class="math">\[(a+2)^2+(b-4)^2=25.\]</span></p>
<p>As both of these expressions equal 25, we can equate them to get<br><span class="math">\[(a+2)^2+(b-4)^2=(a+9)^2+(b+3)^2.\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math">\[\Rightarrow a^2+4a+4+b^2-8b+16=a^2+18a+81+b^2+6b+9\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math">\[\Rightarrow 70=-14a-14b\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math">\[\Rightarrow b=-5-a\]</span></p>
<p>Substituting <span class="math">\(b=-5-a\)</span> into <span class="math">\((a+9)^2+(b+3)^2=25\)</span> gives<br><span class="math">\[(a+9)^2+(-2-a)^2=25.\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math">\[\Rightarrow a^2+18a+81+4+4a+a^2=25\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math">\[\Rightarrow a^2+11a+30=0\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math">\[\Rightarrow (a+5)(a+6)=0\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math">\[\Rightarrow a = -5\]</span> or <span class="math">\[a=-6.\]</span></p>
<p>Substituting these values into <span class="math">\(b=-5-a\)</span>, we get two possible values for <span class="math">\((a,b)\)</span>: <span class="math">\((-5,0)\)</span> and <span class="math">\((-6,1)\)</span>. It’s easy to check that these points are both possibilities for the centre of <span class="math">\(C\)</span> (they do satisfy both equations).</p>
<p>Then, as the circles have radius <span class="math">\(5\)</span>, we get that the equations for these two circles are:<br><span class="math">\[(x+5)^2+y^2=25\]</span><br>and<br><span class="math">\[(x+6)^2+(y-1^2)=25.\]</span></p>
