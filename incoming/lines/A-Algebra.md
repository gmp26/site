# Numbers and algorithms^[Revision 1.0, sfh, vrn, 22 Jan 2013]

##Throughout stress natural properties of algebraic structures.
##Many ubiquitous concepts will be manifested in this strand.

-----      ---------------------------- ----------------------------------------------        
A1         Basic algebra                Surds
           Basic Algebraic Manipulation Difference of 2 squares
                                        Rationalising the denominator
                                        ?? algebra on different number systems

A2         Binomial expansion           Binomial expansion for natural powers

A3         Laws of indices              For any powers

A4 = AE1   Exp and log                  Natural bases
                                        Laws of logs
                                        power equations

                                        Adding and manipulating finites s&s

A6         Infinite sequences and       Concepts of convergence and divergence
           series                       Awareness of 'allowable' operations
                                        Calculation of infinite sums (using intuitive notions of manipulation)

A7         Binomial theorem for any     Note that this is a significant milestone
           power
