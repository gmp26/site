#Cambridge Mathematics Education Project

The Cambridge Mathematics Education Project (CMEP) is an exciting new initiative which aims to support and enhance post-16 maths education. Funded by a grant from the DfE, the project is led by the University of Cambridge Mathematics Faculty and draws on the NRICH mathematics project's experience and expertise in working with schools.

Currently in the development phase, the project will provide innovative resources to help support and inspire teachers and students of sixth-form mathematics. The aim is to help to make sixth-form mathematics a rich, coherent and stimulating experience for students and teachers. 

We shall:

1. Identify the main themes and big ideas that permeate pre-university mathematics and lead into further study and industry.

1. Consider how sixth-form mathematics can inspire and benefit students moving from school into university and the work-place beyond.

1. Create innovative and carefully constructed materials around the themes and big ideas.

1. Consider the most effective ways of helping students to understand the mathematics.

1. Ensure that the materials are engaging and accessible to a wide range of students and teachers.

1. Provide support to mathematics teachers to help them to use the materials effectively.

Throughout the project we shall consider carefully both the learning needs of the students and the associated issues facing the teachers.
