dependencies: 
    - C5
keyQuestions:
    - What do we mean by an antiderivative?
    - Can we find an antiderivative for every polynomial?
    - What do we mean by integration?
    - What is the connection between differentiation and integration?
    - What are the similarities and differences between definite and indefinite integration?
    - What do we mean by the area under a curve, and when can we compute it?
    - If we can't compute an integral precisely, how might we obtain a good approximation instead?
    - How can we use integration to find the volume of a solid of revolution?
