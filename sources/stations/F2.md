title: How can we represent a function by a graph, and how are key properties of a function visible on a graph?
dependencies: 
    - F1
    - G3
keyQuestions:
    - What are the connections between algebraic and graphical representations of a function?
    - What are the graphs of key functions such as polynomials, trigonometric functions, and the modulus function?
    - What do we mean by a _root_ of a function?
    - What kinds of symmetry might a function have?
    - What does it mean to say that a function is _odd_, _even_, or _periodic_, and what are some good examples of functions with some or all of those properties?
    - What is an _asymptote_, and what are some good examples of functions that have one or more asymptotes?
    - What types of behaviour might a function $f(x)$ display for large or small values of $x$?
    - What does it mean for a function to be _convex_ or _linear_, and why are these properties interesting?
    - How can we sketch a function given in parametric form?
