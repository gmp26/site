keyQuestions:
    - What happens if we consider the sum or product of two functions?
    - What do we mean by the _composition_ of two functions, and what are some interesting examples?
    - What do we mean by the _inverse_ of a function, and when does a function have an inverse?
    - In what ways might we transform a function, and what effects do these transformations have?
