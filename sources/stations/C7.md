title: Can we extend our ideas about differentation and integration to functions other than polynomials?
dependencies: 
    - C6
    - F4
    - G3
keyQuestions:
    - How can we find the derivative of sin or cos at a point?
    - How can we integrate sin or cos?
    - What does this new knowledge tell us about the functions sin and cos?
    - How do $\sin(x)$ and $\cos(x)$ behave for small values of $x$?
