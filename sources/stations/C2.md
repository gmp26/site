keyQuestions:
    - What do we mean by the _derivative_ of a function at a point?
    - How can we find the derivative of $x^2$ at a point?
    - How can we find the derivative of $x^3$ at a point?
    - How can we generalise this to find the derivative of $x^n$ for positive integers $n$?
    - What is the effect on the derivative of multiplying a polynomial by a constant?
    - If we know the derivatives of two polynomials at a point, can we find the derivative of their sum at that point?
    - How can we find the derivative of a polynomial?
    - Are there any functions that do not have a derivative at certain points?
