# This is a computer readable transliteration of the files on Camtools
# as of Snapshot of 24th May 2013. 
# Now it's a version with drastic rewriting by Vicky.  But hopefully the original is still there somewhere so I haven't destroyed everything.
#
# I'll split it into individual files at some point. (That was Mike speaking.)
